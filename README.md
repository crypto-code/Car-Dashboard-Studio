## Facial Recognition

  The Facial Recognition used in this app runs entirely using the **face_recognition** library in Python. The model used for facial recognition has a 99.38% accuracy on the Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset. Python is linked to Android Studio using the open source **Chaquopy plugin**. All facial recognition data is stored on a Firebase database.
  
  During the facial recognition stage, the front camera of the Android device is used to capture the image. Then the image is passed as a raw byte stream to the Python backend to extract the facial features. This is then compared against the feature encoding stored in the Firebase database to validate the face.

## APIs Used

- ***Open Weather Map API***:
    This is used to get weather updates on the Dashboard. It calls for update every hour and also if the distance travelled exceeds 50km.

- ***Google Maps API***:
    This is used to display the map on the Dashboard. It is also used to calculate the speed of the vehicle.
    
- ***YouTube Music API***:
    This is used to make the Music Player on the Dashboard. It uses the **ytmusicapi** and **pafy** library in Python.

## Future Prospects

  The app could be connected to an Arduino on the vehicle and when logged in, the app sends a message to the Arduino via Bluetooth to switch on the relay and start the engine.
